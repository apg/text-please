# Text Please!

By Andrew Gwozdziewycz, licensed under the [GNU GPLv3][0]

Text Please is a simple web application, for [Google App Engine][1],
which extracts text from articles and returns them in either simplified HTML,
or Markdown. Similar functionality exists in [InstaPaper][2], but this one is
mine.

It is used as the default source for `[thumb-through-mode][3]`, for GNU Emacs.
